	<p>
		At Chorah Labs, we believe the future of biotech innovation will be shaped by intelligent systems 
		that work hand-in-hand with human experts. Founded by a team of builders with deep experience in 
		biotechnology, software engineering, and systems thinking, we’re on a mission to reduce friction 
		in scientific and regulatory workflows — and help organizations move faster, with more clarity and 
		confidence.
	</p>
	<p>
		We specialize in designing modular, agent-based AI systems that adapt to the unique needs of 
		complex industries like biopharma. From research and development to regulatory submissions, our 
		tools are built to assist teams at every stage of their journey — transforming how they gather 
		insights, make decisions, and deliver results.
	</p>
	<p>
		What sets us apart is our focus on practical intelligence: not just flashy demos, but robust 
		solutions that fit into real-world workflows. Every product we build is grounded in deep domain 
		understanding, ethical design, and the belief that AI should enhance — not replace — human judgment.
	</p>
	<p>
		We’re a small but driven team, blending curiosity with precision. We partner closely with early 
		adopters to co-create tools that solve real problems, and we’re not afraid to go deep into the 
		technical details where it counts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Chorah Labs is still early in its journey — but we’re building with care, conviction, and a long view. 
		If you share our vision for thoughtful innovation in biotech and beyond, we’d love to hear from you.
