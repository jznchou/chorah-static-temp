		Sepehr Antoine Rahimi – Co-Founder, Chorah Labs
    Sepehr Rahimi is a biotech innovator and program leader with deep experience managing high-stakes, highly technical cell and gene therapy programs. Prior to co-founding Chorah Labs, he led complex manufacturing and development projects at a premier CDMO, where he oversaw cross-functional teams, regulatory filings, and multimillion-dollar production campaigns for next-generation therapeutics.
    
    Through this hands-on experience, Sepehr developed an acute awareness of the operational and analytical bottlenecks that slow down drug development — from fragmented data systems to reactive process control. These gaps, he realized, were not just technical issues, but missed opportunities for smarter, faster, AI-driven solutions.
    
    Motivated by this insight, Sepehr co-founded Chorah Labs with a mission to bring cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies into the heart of pharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing. He now spearheads Chorah's strategy to integrate predictive modeling, data harmonization, and intelligent automation into the drug development pipeline — dramatically improving efficiency, quality, and speed-to-patient.
    
    Fluent in four languages and trained in both scientific and managerial disciplines, Sepehr combines systems-level thinking with a passion for impact. At Chorah Labs, he’s building the future of pharma — one algorithm at a time.
