		Jason Chou - Co-Founder
	</h3>
	<p>
		Jason Chou is a biotech leader and problem-solver with over eight years of experience in drug development, 
		manufacturing, and process optimization. Before co-founding Chorah Labs, he led multidisciplinary teams at 
		leading biopharma companies, driving innovation in gene therapy development and scaling advanced manufacturing 
		technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout his career, he has consistently used data, software, and systems thinking to improve how teams work 
		— from streamlining business workflows to building internal tools for process analysis and automation. These 
		experiences revealed a clear pattern: biotech teams are often held back not by science, but by the tools they 
		rely on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Driven to change that, he co-founded Chorah Labs to build smarter software for biopharma teams. By combining AI, 
		automation, and deep industry knowledge, Chorah Labs helps companies unlock faster, more reliable development — so 
		life-saving therapies can reach patients sooner.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a background that bridges science and software, Jason brings a unique perspective to the future of 
		pharma. At Chorah Labs, he’s focused on building tools that empower technical teams to do their best work, every 
		step of the way.

		Sepehr Antoine Rahimi – Co-Founder
	</h3>
	<p>
		Sepehr Rahimi is a biotech innovator and program leader with deep experience managing high-stakes, highly 
		technical cell and gene therapy programs. Prior to co-founding Chorah Labs, he led complex manufacturing and 
		development projects at a premier CDMO, where he oversaw cross-functional teams, regulatory filings, and 
		multimillion-dollar production campaigns for next-generation therapeutics.
    	</p>
	<p>
    		Through this hands-on experience, Sepehr developed an acute awareness of the operational and analytical bottlenecks 
		that slow down drug development — from fragmented data systems to reactive process control. These gaps, he realized, 
		were not just technical issues, but missed opportunities for smarter, faster, AI-driven solutions.
    	</p>
	<p>
    		Motivated by this insight, Sepehr co-founded Chorah Labs with a mission to bring cutting-edge artificial intelligence 
		and machine learning technologies into the heart of pharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing. He now spearheads Chorah 
		Labs's strategy to integrate predictive modeling, data harmonization, and intelligent automation into the drug 
		development pipeline — dramatically improving efficiency, quality, and speed-to-patient.
    	</p>
	<p>
    		Fluent in four languages and trained in both scientific and managerial disciplines, Sepehr combines systems-level thinking with a passion for impact. At Chorah Labs, he’s building the future of pharma — one algorithm at a time.
